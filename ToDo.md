# ToDo List for Assignment 2
Write an application to train your Kohonen network on random colours.
Specifically, create an NxN grid of vectors, each with an appropriate range(Id suggest [0..1]), initially randomized. You'll then be training it on random colour vectors.
- ~~The ~~vector~~grid will be analogous to (and convertible into) an image. Pick an appropriate size eg. 200x200~~
- Train the network for a suitable number of epochs
- Show a colour visualization of the map at some regular interval acress execution
   - For full marks: show an animates window that updates very frequently: every 1-5 epochs
   - for some marks: export (i.e. save) an image of the network every 50 or so epochs
      - If you go this route, at least let the user choose a filename _prefix_, and save them in a specified folder
- Allow for different traininig parameters (command-line entry is fine for this)
